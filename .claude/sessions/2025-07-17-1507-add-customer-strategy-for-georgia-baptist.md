# Session: Add Customer Strategy for Georgia Baptist
**Started:** 2025-07-17 15:07

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-07-17 15:07  
**Focus:** Implementing customer strategy framework for Georgia Baptist customer requirements

## Goals
- [x] Add Georgia Baptist as a customer and create a strategy for parsing their data format
- [x] Support both UPS and POBOX CSV formats for Georgia Baptist
- [x] Implement comprehensive product categories (posters, guides, inserts, envelopes, cards)
- [x] Include shipping and billing address support for UPS format
- [x] Integrate with existing customer strategy framework

## Progress

### ✅ Data Analysis & Type Definitions
- Analyzed Georgia Baptist sample data files (UPS and POBOX formats)
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for both file types
- Defined product categories specific to Georgia Baptist needs
- Updated customer strategy interfaces to support new features

### ✅ Backend Implementation
- Created `GeorgiaBaptistStrategy` class extending the base customer strategy
- Implemented automatic file type detection (UPS vs POBOX)
- Added parsing logic for both CSV formats with proper validation
- Integrated sender/billing address support for UPS shipments
- Added product quantity parsing for 7 different categories
- Registered strategy in the customer service factory

### ✅ Frontend Integration
- Customer selector already supports multiple strategies
- File upload component works with new Georgia Baptist strategy
- PDF generation system ready for Georgia Baptist data
- Customer-specific upload instructions display properly

### Key Features Implemented
- **File Format Support**: Automatic detection of UPS vs POBOX CSV formats
- **Product Categories**: Posters (English/Spanish), Guides (English/Spanish), Inserts, Envelopes, Cards
- **Address Handling**: Recipient, sender, and billing addresses (UPS format)
- **Shipping Details**: Service type, weight, residential flags, account numbers
- **Validation**: Required field validation and ZIP code format checking
- **PDF Generation**: Custom branding and template configuration for Georgia Baptist

### Technical Files Created/Modified
- `backend/src/customers/strategies/georgia-baptist/georgia-baptist.strategy.ts`
- `backend/src/customers/strategies/georgia-baptist/georgia-baptist.types.ts`
- `frontend/src/types/customerStrategy.ts` (enhanced)
- Updated customer module and service registration
- Enhanced base customer interfaces for expanded functionality

### Todo Summary
**Total Tasks:** 5 completed / 0 remaining
**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Examine Georgia Baptist sample data files to understand format
2. ✅ Create customer strategy interface/type definitions
3. ✅ Implement Georgia Baptist customer strategy
4. ✅ Add customer management system to backend
5. ✅ Update frontend to support customer selection

### Key Accomplishments
- **Complete Georgia Baptist Integration:** Successfully implemented full customer strategy for Georgia Baptist with dual format support
- **Robust CSV Parsing:** Migrated from manual CSV parsing to `csv-parse` library for better reliability
- **Product Category Management:** Implemented 7 distinct product categories with proper ordering
- **Multi-Format Support:** Automatic detection and handling of UPS vs POBOX CSV formats
- **Enhanced Type Safety:** Extended base interfaces to support new features

### Features Implemented
1. **Automatic File Type Detection:** UPS vs POBOX format recognition
2. **Product Categories:** Posters (English/Spanish), Guides (English/Spanish), Inserts, Cards, Envelopes
3. **Address Management:** Complete recipient, sender, and billing address support
4. **Shipping Intelligence:** Service types, weights, residential flags, account numbers
5. **Data Validation:** Required field validation and ZIP code format checking
6. **Custom Branding:** Georgia Baptist Mission Board branding configuration
7. **Ordered Item Display:** Items appear on packing slips in specified order

### Problems Encountered and Solutions
1. **Customer Code Mismatch:** 
   - Problem: Frontend using `georgia-baptist` but backend expecting `GEORGIA_BAPTIST`
   - Solution: Updated customer code to match registration key format
2. **CSV Parsing Issues:**
   - Problem: Manual CSV parsing failed with BOM characters and quoted fields
   - Solution: Migrated to `csv-parse` library with proper BOM handling
3. **Item Ordering:**
   - Problem: Items appearing in random order on packing slips
   - Solution: Implemented explicit category ordering array in `createKitItems`

### Dependencies Added
- `csv-parse` - Already available in project for robust CSV parsing

### Configuration Changes
- Updated customer strategy factory registration
- Enhanced base customer interfaces with optional fields
- Added Georgia Baptist to customers module providers

### Breaking Changes
- Extended `CustomerKit` interface with new optional fields (sender, billing, shipping)
- Updated `CustomerKitItem` category types to include Georgia Baptist categories
- Modified `ParsedCustomerData` metadata to support file type detection

### Important Findings
- BOM character handling is crucial for CSV files from certain sources
- Object.entries() doesn't guarantee order - explicit ordering needed for consistent display
- Georgia Baptist uses different field names between UPS and POBOX formats
- Customer strategy pattern allows for easy extension to new customers

### Lessons Learned
- Always use proper CSV parsing libraries instead of manual string splitting
- Test with actual customer data early to catch format issues
- Document expected field orders for packing slip display
- Consider case sensitivity in customer code registration

### What Wasn't Completed
- No pending tasks - all goals achieved
- Could potentially add more robust error handling for malformed CSV files
- Additional validation rules could be implemented for specific field formats

### Tips for Future Developers
1. **CSV Parsing:** Always use `csv-parse` with `columns: true` and BOM handling
2. **Customer Codes:** Ensure consistent case formatting between frontend and backend
3. **Item Ordering:** Use explicit arrays for display order, don't rely on object property order
4. **File Type Detection:** Check for unique headers to distinguish between formats
5. **Testing:** Use actual customer data files during development
6. **Documentation:** Keep product category mappings well-documented for customer reference

### Next Steps for Other Developers
1. Test with larger Georgia Baptist CSV files
2. Consider adding CSV validation preview before processing
3. Add unit tests for the Georgia Baptist strategy
4. Document field mappings for customer reference
5. Consider adding more sophisticated error reporting for validation failures
