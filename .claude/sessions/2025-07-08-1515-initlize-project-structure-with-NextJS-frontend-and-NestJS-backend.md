## Session Summary
**Session Duration:** ~1 hour (15:15 - 16:18)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### Git Summary
- **Total Files Changed:** 99+ files (all new additions)
- **Files Added:**
  - `.gitignore` - Git ignore configuration
  - `package.json` - Root workspace configuration
  - `package-lock.json` - Dependency lock file
  - `frontend/` - Complete NextJS application structure
  - `backend/` - Complete NestJS application structure
  - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with current project structure
- **Commits Made:** 0 (all changes are uncommitted)
- **Final Git Status:** All files untracked (ready for initial commit)

### Todo Summary
**Total Tasks:** 5 completed, 0 remaining
**Completed Tasks:**
✅ Create session file for project initialization
✅ Initialize NextJS frontend structure
✅ Initialize NestJS backend structure
✅ Set up project configuration and dependencies
✅ Create basic project documentation

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Project Structure Created:** Established monorepo with frontend and backend
2. **NextJS Frontend:** Initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and App Router
3. **NestJS Backend:** Full backend structure with TypeScript and testing setup
4. **Development Environment:** Configured concurrent development scripts
5. **Documentation:** Updated CLAUDE.md with complete project structure and commands

### Features Implemented
- Monorepo workspace configuration
- Concurrent development server setup
- TypeScript configuration for both apps
- ESLint and Prettier setup
- Testing framework configuration (Jest)
- Build and deployment scripts
- Git ignore configuration

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
1. **Concurrently Command Not Found:** 
   - Problem: `concurrently` was initially installed in wrong location
   - Solution: Installed in root directory as dev dependency
2. **Nested Backend Directory:**
   - Problem: NestJS CLI created `backend/backend` structure
   - Solution: Moved files to correct `backend/` location

### Dependencies Added
**Root:** `concurrently` (dev)
**Frontend:** `next`, `react`, `typescript`, `tailwindcss`, `eslint`
**Backend:** `@nestjs/core`, `@nestjs/common`, `typescript`, `jest`, `eslint`

### Development Commands Available
- `npm run dev` - Start both apps concurrently
- `npm run build` - Build both apps for production
- `npm run test` - Run tests for both apps
- `npm run lint` - Lint both applications

### What's Ready
- ✅ Frontend: NextJS app running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Backend: NestJS app structure ready (default port 3001)
- ✅ Development environment fully configured

### Next Steps for Future Development
1. Set up PostgreSQL database connection
2. Create API endpoints for template management
3. Implement drag-and-drop interface components
4. Add authentication/authorization
5. Build customer management system

### Tips for Future Developers
- Use `npm run dev` from root to start both apps
- Frontend code goes in `frontend/src/`
- Backend code goes in `backend/src/`
- Both apps are configured with TypeScript
