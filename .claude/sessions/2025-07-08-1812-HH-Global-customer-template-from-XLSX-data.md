### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Customer Strategy System Implementation
- Created complete customer strategy pattern architecture
- Implemented HH Global strategy with XLSX parsing capability
- Built customer strategy factory for extensibility
- Added customer-specific template customization

#### 2. File Upload & Processing System
- Implemented XLSX file upload functionality
- Added file validation and parsing
- Created customer-specific file processing pipeline
- Added comprehensive error handling

#### 3. Backend Infrastructure Enhancements
- Implemented customer management module with controller and service
- Added batch PDF generation with ZIP file creation
- Integrated customer strategies with PDF generation system
- Fixed critical PayloadTooLargeError for large batch operations

#### 4. Frontend UI Components
- Created CustomerFileUpload component for file handling
- Added CustomerSelector for customer strategy selection
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces for customer strategies
- Enhanced existing sidebar with customer functionality

#### 5. Development Environment Improvements
- Created comprehensive VS Code debug configuration
- Added combined frontend/backend launch configuration
- Set up proper TypeScript support throughout

### Features Implemented

#### Customer Strategy System
- **Base Strategy Pattern:** Abstract base class and interface
- **HH Global Strategy:** Complete XLSX parsing and template customization
- **Strategy Factory:** Registration and retrieval system
- **Template Customization:** Customer-specific branding and rules

#### File Processing Pipeline
- **XLSX File Upload:** Multer-based file handling
- **Data Validation:** Customer-specific validation rules
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error reporting
- **Batch Processing:** Support for large file processing

#### PDF Generation System
- **Batch PDF Creation:** Generate multiple PDFs from customer data
- **ZIP File Creation:** Bundle PDFs for download
- **Customer Templates:** Apply customer-specific formatting
- **Streaming Response:** Efficient file download handling

### Problems Encountered and Solutions

#### 1. PayloadTooLargeError
**Problem:** Request entity too large (280KB vs 100KB limit)
**Solution:** Increased body parser limit to 10MB in main.ts:9-10
**Impact:** Allows batch processing of 224+ packing slips

#### 2. Missing Request Body Parsing
**Problem:** generate-pdfs endpoint receiving 0 kits
**Solution:** Added @Body() decorator and proper validation in customers.controller.ts:76-86
**Impact:** Fixed batch PDF generation functionality

#### 3. VS Code Debug Configuration Issues
**Problem:** Invalid protocol property in launch.json
**Solution:** Removed unsupported protocol property and added proper body parser configuration
**Impact:** Improved development debugging experience

### Dependencies Added
- **JSZip:** For ZIP file creation in batch PDF generation
- **body-parser:** Enhanced request body parsing (configuration change)

### Configuration Changes
- **Backend main.ts:** Increased body parser limits to 10MB
- **VS Code launch.json:** Added debug configurations for combined frontend/backend launch
- **Customer Module:** Integrated into main app module

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are additive and backward compatible

### Important Findings
- The existing PDF generation system integrates well with customer strategies
- Customer-specific template customization requires careful data mapping
- Large batch operations need proper request size configuration
- Strategy pattern provides excellent extensibility for multiple customers

### What Wasn't Completed
- Database integration for customer data persistence
- Frontend integration with new customer components
- Authentication/authorization for customer-specific access
- Advanced error handling and retry mechanisms
- Performance optimization for very large files
- Unit tests for new customer functionality

### Tips for Future Developers
1. **Customer Strategy Extension:** Follow the pattern in HH Global strategy for new customers
2. **File Processing:** Use the existing validation pipeline for consistent error handling
3. **PDF Generation:** Customer templates should map to the standard packing slip format
4. **Batch Operations:** Consider memory usage for very large file processing
5. **Error Handling:** Always validate file uploads and provide meaningful error messages
6. **Testing:** Test with actual customer data files to ensure proper parsing

### Next Steps Recommended
1. Implement frontend integration for customer file upload
2. Add database persistence for processed customer data
3. Create comprehensive test suite for customer strategies
4. Add progress tracking for large batch operations
5. Implement customer-specific authentication
6. Add monitoring and logging for production deployment
