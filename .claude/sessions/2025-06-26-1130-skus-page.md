## Todo Summary

- **Completed:** 7
- **Remaining:** 1 (testing - completed by user)

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Analyze current handleSaveSku logic and identify what specific logic needs to be added
2. ✅ Review SkuModal component to understand the form structure  
3. ✅ Check backend API endpoint to understand expected data format
4. ✅ Identify specific business logic that needs to be added to handleSaveSku
5. ✅ Add auto-calculation logic for isDuplex based on format and page count
6. ✅ Add sheet count auto-calculation for booklets
7. ✅ Convert Size input to dropdown with predefined sizes

### Remaining Tasks:
- Testing completed by user (confirmed working)

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Smart Auto-Calculation Logic
Implemented comprehensive auto-calculation in `SkuModal.tsx` that triggers when users change format or page count:

**isDuplex Auto-Calculation:**
- Memo_Duplex format → always duplex (true)
- Booklet format with >1 pages → duplex (true)
- All other combinations → simplex (false)

**Sheet Count Auto-Calculation:**
- Booklet format → Math.ceil(pageCount/2)
- Other formats → manual entry allowed
- Shows "(auto-calculated)" hint and disables input for booklets

### 2. Format-Based Field Population
When selecting specific formats (Binder, Booklet, Memo, Memo_Duplex):
- **Material** → automatically set to "Paper"
- **Size** → automatically set to "8.5x11"
- **Page Count** → Memo=1, Memo_Duplex=2

### 3. Enhanced UI/UX
- Converted Size field from text input to dropdown with predefined options:
  - 8.5x11, 8.5x14, 11x17, 12x18, 22x21, 22x30, 22x34, 22x42, 22x51, 22x55
- Added visual indicators for auto-calculated fields
- Disabled auto-calculated inputs with proper styling
- Added helpful hints showing when fields are auto-calculated

## Features Implemented

### Core Auto-Calculation Engine
- **Multi-field dependency logic** in `handleInputChange()`
- **Cascading updates** when format or page count changes
- **Conditional field enabling/disabling** based on format

### Business Rules Implementation
- **Document type intelligence** - system knows the characteristics of each format
- **Government document standards** - appropriate defaults for paper-based documents
- **Print production logic** - duplex determination and sheet calculations

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Intelligent defaults** reduce manual data entry
- **Visual feedback** shows which fields are auto-calculated
- **Consistent sizing options** via dropdown selection
- **Real-time field updates** as user makes selections

## Technical Implementation Details

### Code Architecture
- Enhanced existing `handleInputChange()` function with business logic
- Maintained React state management patterns
- Preserved existing form validation and error handling
- Added conditional rendering for auto-calculated field hints

### Data Flow
1. User selects format → triggers auto-calculation logic
2. System determines appropriate defaults (material, size, page count)
3. Duplex status calculated based on format + page count rules
4. Sheet count calculated for booklets using Math.ceil formula
5. UI updates with visual indicators for auto-calculated fields

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### Initial Challenge: Understanding Business Rules
- **Problem:** Unclear how duplex determination should work
- **Solution:** Clarified that Memo_Duplex + Booklets >1 page = duplex, others = simplex

### UI Consistency Challenge
- **Problem:** Showing calculated values in disabled fields
- **Solution:** Enhanced logic to populate calculated values and added visual indicators

### Sheet Count Display Issue
- **Problem:** User wanted to see actual calculated sheet count value
- **Solution:** Modified logic to populate the input field with calculated value rather than leaving empty

## Configuration Changes
- Enhanced form field dependencies in SkuModal component
- Added new dropdown options for Size field
- Modified field enablement logic based on format selection

## Dependencies
- **No new dependencies added**
- Leveraged existing React patterns and class-validator backend validation
- Used existing Tailwind CSS classes for styling

## Breaking Changes
- **None** - All changes are additive enhancements to existing functionality
- Existing API endpoints and data structures remain unchanged
- Backward compatible with existing SKU data

## Important Findings

### Business Logic Insights
- Government document formats have predictable characteristics
- Paper-based documents predominantly use 8.5x11 size
- Duplex determination follows clear format-based rules
- Sheet count calculation is essential for booklet production planning

### UX Improvements Needed
- Auto-calculation significantly reduces data entry errors
- Visual feedback helps users understand system behavior
- Intelligent defaults improve workflow efficiency

## Lessons Learned

### Development Process
- Understanding business domain rules is crucial before implementation
- Incremental enhancement approach worked well for complex forms
- User feedback during development improved final implementation

### Technical Patterns
- React state updates with derived calculations require careful dependency management
- Form auto-calculation should preserve user agency while providing intelligent defaults
- Visual indicators for auto-calculated fields improve user confidence

## What Wasn't Completed
- **Testing:** User confirmed functionality works as expected
- **Deployment:** Changes remain in working directory, not committed
- **Documentation:** Could add inline code comments for complex business logic

## Tips for Future Developers

### Code Maintenance
- Business rules are concentrated in `handleInputChange()` - update there for logic changes
- Auto-calculation triggers on 'format' and 'pageCount' field changes
- Visual indicators use conditional CSS classes and hint text

### Business Rule Updates
- To modify duplex rules: update the conditional logic in isDuplex calculation
- To change format defaults: modify the format array check and associated field assignments
- To adjust sheet count calculation: update the Math.ceil formula

### Testing Considerations
- Test all format combinations with various page counts
- Verify auto-calculated fields are properly disabled/enabled
- Ensure manual overrides work for non-auto-calculated scenarios

### Performance Notes
- Auto-calculation runs on every relevant field change - acceptable for form context
- Consider debouncing if performance issues arise with complex calculations
- State updates are batched within single handleInputChange call
