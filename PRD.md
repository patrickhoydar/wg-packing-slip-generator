Got it! That sounds like a really cool project. For the prompt, we can frame it to guide Claude into understanding the current functionality and then what you want the new drag-and-drop interface to achieve. Here's a starting point for the prompt:

---

**Project Overview:**

We have an existing application that parses customer order files in CSV format and generates packing slips with box contents, shipping details, and other relevant information. This app was originally tailored for a specific customer, Just Right Reader, and is currently not flexible enough to be used for other customers.

**Goal:**

We want to evolve this application into a more dynamic, user-friendly, and customizable tool. The new version will feature a drag-and-drop interface that allows internal users at Wallace Graphics to create fully customized packing slips that meet the unique needs of different customers. The interface should support easy customization of fields, layout adjustments, and the inclusion of customer-specific data points.

**Key Features:**

* A drag-and-drop editor for creating and customizing packing slip templates.
* Support for multiple customers with unique requirements.
* Flexibility to define and save different templates for different customers.

**Tech Stack:**

* Frontend: Likely React/Next.js for the drag-and-drop UI.
* Backend: Node.js/NestJS for handling data processing and storage.
* Database: PostgreSQL for storing templates and order details.

**Desired Outcome:**
By the end of the project, we should have a functional prototype or MVP that allows non-technical users to create and customize packing slips efficiently, reducing dependency on manual coding and making the process more scalable.

We can refine this further based on any additional details or specific requirements you have in mind!
