## 9. Special Processing Requirements

### Quantity Format Parsing
- **PM Orders**: Parse `"2, K"` format to extract:
  - Quantity: `2`
  - Grade Level: `K`
- **TE Orders**: Parse `"30, No Sticker"` or `"28, Needs Sticker: K"` format to extract:
  - Quantity: `30` or `28`
  - Sticker Requirement: `true/false`
  - Grade Level: `K` (when sticker needed)

### File Type Detection
- **PM Orders**: Presence of `IND-IJ-PM-*` columns
- **TE Orders**: Presence of `IND-IJ-TE-*` columns
- **Validation**: Ensure file contains only one type

### SKU Lookup Integration
- **Load Lookup Table**: Parse `Packing Slip Look Up Table.csv` on startup
- **SKU Mapping**: Map column headers to SKU codes
- **Description Retrieval**: Get full product descriptions
- **Category Assignment**: Classify as PM or TE based on SKU pattern

### Address Processing
- **Multi-line Addresses**: Handle addresses with embedded newlines
- **Address Parsing**: Extract street, city, state, zip from combined field
- **Validation**: Ensure address components are complete

## 10. Testing Strategy

### Test Data Requirements

- **Integration Tests**: Full file processing pipeline for both PM and TE
- **Validation Tests**: All validation rules including quantity format validation
- **Error Handling Tests**: Invalid file formats, missing required fields

## 11. Deployment Considerations

### Environment Requirements
- **Development**: Access to sample data files
- **Staging**: Full SKU lookup table integration
- **Production**: Performance optimization for large school district orders

### Performance Considerations
- **File Size Limits**: Support for large district orders (500+ schools)
- **Processing Time**: Efficient SKU lookup and quantity parsing
- **Memory Usage**: Optimize for large CSV files

### Monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Quantity parsing errors, SKU lookup failures
- **Performance Metrics**: File processing time, kit generation speed
- **Business Metrics**: Order completion rates, delivery date compliance
