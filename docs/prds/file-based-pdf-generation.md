# File-Based PDF Generation with Merging

## Overview
Replace the current memory-based PDF generation approach with a file-based system that generates individual PDFs to temporary files and merges them into a single consolidated PDF for download.

## Problem Statement
The current implementation keeps all generated PDFs in memory, which causes:
- High memory usage leading to browser connection failures
- Poor scalability for large batches
- Memory pressure on the persistent browser instance
- Garbage collection overhead

## Current Implementation Issues
```typescript
// Current approach - all PDFs in memory
for (let i = 0; i < kits.length; i++) {
  const pdfBuffer = await this.pdfService.generatePackingSlipPdf(packingSlipData);
  zip.file(filename, pdfBuffer); // Memory accumulation
}
```

## Solution Overview
Implement a file-based approach that:
1. Generates individual PDFs to temporary files
2. Merges them into a single PDF using pdf-lib
3. Returns the merged PDF as a single file download
4. Cleans up temporary files automatically

## Technical Requirements

### 1. File-Based PDF Generation
- Generate individual PDFs to temporary directory
- Use OS temp directory with unique session folders
- Parallel PDF generation where possible
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### 2. PDF Merging
- Use pdf-lib for efficient PDF merging
- Maintain page order and quality
- Handle large numbers of pages efficiently
- Preserve PDF formatting and fonts

### 3. Memory Management
- Minimize memory footprint during generation
- Stream-based file operations where possible
- Immediate cleanup of individual PDFs after merging
- Efficient garbage collection patterns

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of disk space issues
- Cleanup on error conditions
- Retry mechanisms for file operations
- Proper error propagation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: File-Based PDF Generation Service
Create a new service that handles file-based PDF operations:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class FileBasedPdfService {
  private readonly tempDir = path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'wg-packing-slips');
  
  async generateBatchPDFs(customerCode: string, kits: CustomerKit[]): Promise<Buffer> {
    // Implementation details
  }
  
  private async generatePDFToFile(kit: CustomerKit, outputPath: string): Promise<void> {
    // Generate PDF and save to file
  }
  
  private async mergePDFs(pdfFilePaths: string[]): Promise<Buffer> {
    // Merge PDFs using pdf-lib
  }
  
  private async cleanupTempFiles(sessionDir: string): Promise<void> {
    // Clean up temporary files
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Update Customer Service
Modify the existing customer service to use the file-based approach:

```typescript
async generateBatchPDFs(customerCode: string, kits: any[]): Promise<Buffer> {
  return this.fileBasedPdfService.generateBatchPDFs(customerCode, kits);
}
```

### Phase 3: Frontend Updates
Update the UI to reflect the new single PDF download:
- Change "Download All PDFs (ZIP)" to "Download Merged PDF"
- Update file naming convention
- Improve download progress indicators

## Technical Implementation Details

### Temporary File Structure
```
/tmp/wg-packing-slips/
├── session-{timestamp}-{uuid}/
│   ├── kit-001-customer-name.pdf
│   ├── kit-002-customer-name.pdf
│   └── ...
└── merged-{customerCode}-{timestamp}.pdf
```

### PDF Generation Flow
1. **Create Session Directory**: Unique temp directory per batch
2. **Parallel Generation**: Generate individual PDFs concurrently
3. **File Validation**: Verify each PDF was created successfully
4. **Merge PDFs**: Combine all PDFs into single document
5. **Return Buffer**: Return merged PDF as buffer
6. **Cleanup**: Remove all temporary files

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Disk Space**: Check available space before generation
- **File Permissions**: Ensure write permissions to temp directory
- **PDF Corruption**: Validate each generated PDF
- **Cleanup Failures**: Log but don't fail the main operation

## Performance Improvements

### Expected Benefits
- **Memory Usage**: 80-90% reduction in peak memory usage
- **Scalability**: Handle 100+ PDFs without memory issues
- **Browser Stability**: Reduced memory pressure on persistent browser
- **User Experience**: Single PDF file easier to manage than ZIP

### Benchmarking Metrics
- Memory usage during generation
- Time to generate batch PDFs
- Browser connection stability
- Successful completion rate for large batches

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies
```json
{
  "pdf-lib": "^1.17.1"
}
```

### System Requirements
- Sufficient disk space for temporary files
- Read/write permissions to OS temp directory
- Node.js fs/promises support

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```typescript
export interface FileBasedPdfConfig {
  tempDirectory: string;           // Default: os.tmpdir()
  maxConcurrentGenerations: number; // Default: 3
  cleanupOnError: boolean;         // Default: true
  retryAttempts: number;           // Default: 2
  sessionTimeoutMs: number;        // Default: 300000 (5 minutes)
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual PDF generation
- PDF merging functionality
- Cleanup operations
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end batch processing
- Large batch performance
- Memory usage validation
- Browser stability testing

### Performance Tests
- Compare memory usage: file-based vs memory-based
- Benchmark generation time for various batch sizes
- Stress test with 100+ PDFs

## Rollback Strategy

### Gradual Migration
1. **Feature Flag**: Toggle between old and new implementation
2. **A/B Testing**: Run both implementations in parallel
3. **Monitoring**: Track performance metrics and error rates
4. **Rollback**: Quick revert if issues arise

### Fallback Mechanism
```typescript
async generateBatchPDFs(customerCode: string, kits: any[]): Promise<Buffer> {
  try {
    if (this.configService.get('USE_FILE_BASED_PDF')) {
      return await this.fileBasedPdfService.generateBatchPDFs(customerCode, kits);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.warn('File-based PDF generation failed, falling back to memory-based', error);
  }
  
  // Fallback to existing implementation
  return await this.memoryBasedPdfGeneration(customerCode, kits);
}
```
